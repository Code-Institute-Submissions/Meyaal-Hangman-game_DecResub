## Hangman game 

### This game is a word game where the goal is to guess the word by selecting different letters until the word is complete. The user is presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters that they will need to find. This game was created to complete the second Milestone Project for Code Insitute's Full Stack Software Developer course.

#### Live Site [Here](https://meys-game.herokuapp.com/)

#### How to play

* The user need to enter their name and once entered, the user will be presented with the number of letters in the word and blank spaces for each letter.

* The user need to type a letter on the keybord.
* If the letter the user choses, exists in the answer, then all the blank spaces, where that letter exists, will be populated with that letter.
* The user have nine tries.
* If the user cannot guess the word and exceeds the lives, the hangman will be completed and the game will be over.

## Features

The game features a welcome message to the user and when the user starts the game, it will ask the user to type their name. The username must be letters only, if the user puts a number, an error message with appear instructing the user that the name must be letters only.

If the letter guessed by the user matches any of the letters in the word, the letter will appear in the blank space where that letter belongs. In the following screenshot, the letter "a" was guessed and it appeared on the blank space.

User can only guess a letter, if they use a number or a special character, then they will get an error message that they have to select a letter.

* If the letter guessed by the user is incorrect, the hangman picture will be populated piece by piece, starting from head to the legs. Also, the wrong letter will be displayed to the user. If the user selects a letter that has already been chosen, the following message will appear "You already guessed it, please try again". The following screenshot displays the message. A list with already chosen and wrong letters appears so the user knows wich letters they already choosed.

* If the user can guess the word, the user will receive a congratulations message and they will win the game.

## Future features

I'll add a function that shows what the right word was in case the choice was wrong.

## Technologies used

### Languages
. Python

## Frameworks, Deployement & Libraries

* [Github](https://github.com/)

* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io)

## Testing

* Testing was done throughout the project mainly by running the program in the terminal as well as python debugger. I committed the codes to github after writing every new list or code.

* I used the deployed site to manually type correct and incorrect data to validate and see how the program responded.

## Accessibility

* There are no images on the site.
* The whole project was built using python, therefore no other langueges were used.

## Issues and bugs

## Validator Testing
I ran through my file in [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/)

The Code has one warning, I tried to fix that but I couldn't find or see the newline presented in the warning.

## Deployment

I followed the below steps when deploying my project to Heroku, based on the Code Institute instructions:

* Add to requirements.txt file:-
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
Commit changes to Github:
git commit -m "Add requirements for deployment‚Äù

In HEROKU after creating the account:

1. "Create new App"

2. Give the App a unique name and enter region

3. Click on "Create App"

4. Click on "Settings" on your new App Dashboard

5. Scroll down to Config Vars where in my instance I only inserted KEY: PORT and VALUE: 8000 since I have no creds.json files to add.

6. Press Add-button

7. Scroll down to Buildpacks and press the icon for Python, click Save Changes, then press the icon for Nodejs and save changes. These Buildpacks need to be in below order:

Python NodeJS

8. Go to Deploy section tab and scroll down to Deployment Method. I connected to my Github pages and could thereafter search for my Github Repository "Parents Allowance Calculator" and then click connect.

9. Scroll down to Automatic and Manual Deploys sections. I clicked on Automatic Deployment so that my changes that I push to github automatically updates in Heroku.

10. Then in the Manual Deploy section, press Deploy Branch.

11. After project has been deployed successfully I clicked the View-button to see the program run in the terminal.
